## Other researches and my own Research indicates at least two major waves of admixture in Uyghur genetics. The first wave involved Indo-European admixture with local groups, followed by a second wave involving Turkic (Siberian Hunter Gatherer) admixture.

# Radar plot with different matrics
My DNA shows a closer genetic alignment with Modern Uyghur than with Khotanese Saka based on several similarity measures. For example, the Cosine, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances indicate a stronger similarity to Modern Uyghur. However, in Chebyshev and Bray-Curtis similarity, my DNA is more closely aligned with Khotanese Saka. Additionally, the correlation coefficient between my DNA and Modern Uyghur is higher, while the Minkowski distance also reflects a stronger similarity to Modern Uyghur.
